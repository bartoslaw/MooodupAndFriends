# MooodupAndFriends
Opensource project for Saturday coding session
For now we will focus on three things:
<br />
1) Authentication module: <br />
	* registration <br />
	* login <br />
2) Listing all the projects <br />
	* listing all the tasks <br />
	* listing all the issues <br />
3) Details of the project <br />
	* details of the tasks <br />
	* details of the issues <br />
4) Notification service <br />
<br />
If we have time for more - great, but let's try at least those modules. <br />
Proposed architecture MVVM <br />
rest client - Retrofit <br />
event bus - tinybus <br />
DI - dagger 2 <br />
view binding - Butterknife <br />
lets use rxJava? <br />
<br />
Probably no graphics will attend hackathon so we go with material-ish design keeping in mind palette of taiga.io. <br />
If somebody has some ideas -- let me know :) <br />
