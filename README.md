# MooodupAndFriends
Opensource project for Saturday coding session
For now we will focus on three things:

1) Authentication module:
	* registration
	* login
2) Listing all the projects
	* listing all the tasks
	* listing all the issues
3) Details of the project 
	* details of the tasks
	* details of the issues
4) Notification service

If we have time for more - great, but let's try at least those modules.
Proposed architecture MVVM
rest client - Retrofit
event bus - tinybus
DI - dagger 2
view binding - Butterknife
lets use rxJava?

Probably no graphics will attend hackathon so we go with material-ish design keeping in mind palette of taiga.io.
If somebody has some ideas -- let me know :)
